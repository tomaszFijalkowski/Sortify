<h1>Audio features</h1>

<mat-dialog-content>
  <p><span class="bold">Acousticness</span> is a confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Danceability</span> describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Energy</span> represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Instrumentalness</span> predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The higher the value, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Liveness</span> detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Loudness</span> - the overall loudness averaged across the entire track in decibels (dB).</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Speechiness</span> detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audiobook, poetry), the higher the attribute value.</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Tempo</span> - the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).</p>

  <p><span class="bold">Valence</span> is a measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</p>
