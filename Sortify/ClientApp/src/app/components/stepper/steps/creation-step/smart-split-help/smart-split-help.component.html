<h1>Smart Split</h1>

<mat-dialog-content>
  <p>Avoids splitting the playlist on either an album or an artist.</p>

  <p>For example, if you were splitting a 200 track playlist into two 100 track ones and a 15 track album started at position 90,
     it would adjust the output to create 105 and 95 track playlists instead.</p>

  <p>Use Smart Split if you want to contain the whole album (or artist respectively) in one playlist and don't mind adjusted playlist sizes.</p>
